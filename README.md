MHW Builder is character armoury tool for building your Monster Hunter World Character.

ToDo list:

1. Fully working character armoury with popup equipment menu and sorting
2. Approximate damage numbers for weakzones
3. Canteen simulator
4. And so on!

Please note, that autoit binaries get false positive virus checks. So if you dont trust my compiled .exe's you can always build it by yourself. I added a lil guide at my website to tip you. http://honeyhunterworld.com/2018/03/29/how-to-compile-your-au3-file-into-binary/

Donations are not nessesary, but are always welcome, motivating me to keep working on my tool and bringing new ideas to my ToDo list.
